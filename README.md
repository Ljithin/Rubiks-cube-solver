# Rubik's Cube Solver (Educase India Assignment)

This is a JavaScript-based Rubik's Cube solver built for an internship/fresher coding task.

## ✅ Features
- Object-Oriented Cube Representation
- Manual Face Rotation
- Random Scramble Generation
- Basic Reversal-Based Solving
- Step-by-Step State Visualization using `getCubeSvg()` (mock included)

## 📦 Files
- `index.html` – Main UI with buttons
- `cube.js` – Cube logic, rotation, scramble, solve
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Use the buttons to scramble and solve the cube

## 🚧 To Do
- Implement all face rotations (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`, `B`)
- Integrate with real `getCubeSvg()` if provided
- Implement layer-by-layer solving algorithm

## ⚠️ Notes
This implementation focuses on demonstrating:
- Clean object-oriented design
- Functional logic
- Visual updates per step
